# Scalable and cost-effective ribonuclease-based rRNA depletion for bacterial transcriptomics

Jupyter Notebook:

* 0.design_probe.ipynb: design probe libraries for target 16S and 23S rRNA sequence

* 1.calculate_probe_identity.ipynb: calculate probe identity to various different 16S and 23S sequences to evaluate the ability of pools to be applied to different sequences

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7, jupyter 4.3.0 
	- panda
	- numpy
	- _NB: Above libraries are bundled together in the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)_
